# suctorian_viewer

Visualization of digitized suctorian morphologies, dynamic trajectories, and simulation data.

`suctorian_viewer` is a `pyqtgraph` application for visualization of digitized single-cell suctorian morphologies, dynamic trajectories, population-level morphospaces, and simulation data. Provides a means of viewing, exploring, and manipulating all of the data associated with the manuscript "A morphological circuit optimizes single-cell predation in the suctorian P. collini", Xu et al. 2025.

## Installation

This application uses PyQt5, PyOpenGL and pyqtgraph to handle fast 3D vieweing of cell morphologies. Install the package with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CoyleLab-UW-Madison/suctorian_viewer
```

then run the application as

```bash
suctorian-viewer
```

Note this package is still in early stages of development.
